<h2>What is Balancer?</h2>
<p>
  Balancer is an app that allows you to record each denomination for various
  cash locations. It will do the math for in adding up the total and you can get
  the total for all cash locations by using to the "Total" screen.
</p>
<p>
  The app is mostly intended for tellers to use at banks, but the app can be
  used for anyone who is balancing a drawer.
</p>
<p>
  When there is money in a location, the location will light of green. In each
  location, there is a loose and an optional wrapped count, and if there is
  money in either they will light up green when there is money in them.
</p>

  If you want to count a location over you can clear it, or if you want to start
  from scratch from all your locations you can clear everything by hitting clear
  on the "Total" section.
