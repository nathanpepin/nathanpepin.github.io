          <h2>What is Kegal HIIT?</h2>
          <p>
            Kegal HIIT implements concepts from HIIT and applies them to kegals.
          </p>
          <p>
            HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training. In HIIT, a high
            intensity exercise (such as sprinting) is done for a set amount of
            time, say 15 seconds. What follows is a rest activity such as
            walking for a set amount of time, say 30 seconds. This cycle is done
            for a number of repetitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As can be gathered, this sort of training is intense, which is
            partly why it can be so effective. Two of the main benefits of the
            method are that they are time effective and that they are easy to
            keep track of and progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progression can take a few different forms, it might involve any
            combination of increasing the high intensity time, decreasing the
            low intensity time, or increasing the amount of repetitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kegal HIIT takes this concept and applies it to the process of
            squeezing your pelvic floor muscles.

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            There are four main factors in Kegal HIIT:
          </p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Squeeze Time:</strong> The is the amount of time you are
            contracting your PC muscles
          </p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Rest Time:</strong> This is the amount of time you rest for.
          </p>
          <p class="point"><strong>Reps:</strong> The amount of repetitions.</p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Last Rep:</strong> Squeeze for whatever remaining time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is recommended to choose Smart Trainer at first. It will start
            you at level 1 and will take you all the way up to level infinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Manual Training mode is useful if you don’t want to continue
            your Smart Training and you want to program your own session for
            reasons of time or experimentation.
          </p>

          <h2>How do you do kegal?</h2>
          <p>
            Kegals are much easier to do than people think. Whenever you stop
            the flow of urine midstream you are using your pelvic floor muscles
            to do so. To start with, simply pretend like you are doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            With practice and as you gain strength you won't need to think of it
            like that anymore
          </p>

          <h2>How Hard Is It?</h2>
          <p>
            For most people, level Level 1 will be easy and it is designed to be
            that way. Take it seriously, progress, and then see how easy level
            10 is. Failure is expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people may experience some difficulty at the start as they
            won't exactly be able to feel if they are doing a kegal or not. It
            is recommended that these people just keep working at it and it is
            assured the mind muscle connection will be built. Looking up
            articles and videos about how to do kegals might also help.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is Failure? How Do I Know If I Failed?</h2>
          <p>
            Failure is when you start missing reps. If you are supposed to be
            squeezing for 10 seconds and you only squeeze for 5 seconds, that is
            failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you fail a rep, it is recommended you do not progress to the
            next workout and instead repeat the previous workout. This can be
            done by clicking the back button after the workout is completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you fail a rep, there is still much to be gained from the
            workout.
          </p>

          <h2>How Often Should I Train?</h2>
          <p>
            It is recommendation to train 3-7 times per week. Twice a day is
            very doable. Workouts tend to be short, so doing them during little
            periods of wait time can be very helpful.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is A Kegal Max?</h2>
          <p>
            Once you hit Level 21, the progression scheme will change slightly
            and you start training what is called your Kegal Max.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Kegal Max is much like your bench press max: it is max load
            that you can handle. Instead of doing multiple reps, you instead do
            one big rep. This is meant to be challenging and you are not always
            expected to progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you beat your old max, the next cycle will be based on your new
            max. This means that you ought not to cheat as you may find yourself
            over your head with the workouts.
          </p>
