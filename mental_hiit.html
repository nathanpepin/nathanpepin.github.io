          <h2>What is Mental HIIT?</h2>
          <p>
            Mental HIIT implements concepts from HIIT and applies them to
            meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training. In HIIT, a high
            intensity exercise (such as sprinting) is done for a set amount of
            time, say 15 seconds. What follows is a rest activity such as
            walking for a set amount of time, say 30 seconds. This cycle is done
            for a number of repetitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As can be gathered, this sort of training is intense, which is
            partly why it can be so effective. Two of the main benefits of the
            method are that they are time effective and that they are easy to
            keep track of and progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progression can take a few different forms, it might involve any
            combination of increasing the high intensity time, decreasing the
            low intensity time, or increasing the amount of repetitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental HIIT takes this concept and applies it to the process of
            focusing.

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>There are four main factors in Mental HIIT:</p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Focus Time:</strong> The is the amount of time you are
            attempting to maintain uninterrupted awareness.
          </p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Rest Time:</strong> This is the amount of time you rest for.
            During this period it is perfectly fine to let your mind wander,
            scratch an itch, make plans to reunite with your long lost best
            friend from second grade. Don’t think of it like that though, during
            these seconds you need to rest up enough to focus again.
          </p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Reps:</strong> The amount of repetitions. Note that
            initially your reps will be high as your focus and rest time will be
            low, but as they increase your reps will decrease to control for
            time.
          </p>
          <p class="point">
            <strong>Cool Down:</strong> The cool down period is intended to be
            used a standard meditation period. This allows you to integrate your
            current meditation practice with your Mental HIIT. It is optional to
            have a cool down.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is recommended to choose Smart Trainer at first. It will start
            you at level 1 and will take you all the way up to level infinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Manual Training mode is useful if you don’t want to continue
            your Smart Training and you want to program your own session for
            reasons of time or experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the sound cues to guide you. There is a three second count in to
            help you get prepared, and then you go into your session.
          </p>

          <h2>How Hard Is It?</h2>
          <p>
            For most people, level Level 1 will be easy and it is designed to be
            that way. Take it seriously, progress, and then see how easy level
            10 is. Failure is expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your first goal is to go from a focus max of 5 seconds to a focus
            max of 1 minute.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is Failure? How Do I Know If I Failed?</h2>
          <p>
            You might be wondering how you know if you failed, I mean, what does
            failure really mean in context to focusing?
          </p>
          <p>
            Failure occurs when miss a rep. Missing a rep is getting distracted
            and losing your focus during your focus time. Getting distracted
            does not mean having thoughts or noticing new sounds, it means more
            that your train of thought got derailed and you do not know how or
            when you go on this new train.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine the focus period is like are holding some heavy weights in
            your hands. Failing is not having an itch, getting a thought about
            how great your prom night was 20 years ago, or realizing that Puff
            Daddy is a brilliant rapper, no failure is breaking contact with the
            weights and dropping them.
          </p>

          <h2>How Often Should I Train?</h2>
          <p>It is recommendation to train 3-7 times per week.</p>

          <h2>What Is A Focus Max?</h2>
          <p>
            Once you hit Level 21, the progression scheme will change slightly
            and you start training what is called your Focus Max.
          </p>
          <p>
            This figure can be thought of as your 1 Rep Max in terms of weight
            lifting, but applied to how long you can focus for uninterrupted.
            The different training scheme is needed because the greater the
            ability you have to focus, the more complex methods you need to
            train it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are testing your focus max, your goal is to go for as long
            as you can until you fail your rep. It is advised you be more
            critical of if you failed as your next level will be based on this
            measure. As soon as your mental form breaks down consider the test
            over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methodology that Mental HIIT uses is intended to increase the
            length you are able to focus for uninterrupted, but it also has the
            side effect of increasing your awareness of when you lose focus.
            This is because as you climb the levels, you start to experience
            focus fatigue, and this in turn gives you awareness of when you are
            losing your focus.
